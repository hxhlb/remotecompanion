# RemoteCompanion

RemoteCompanion provides fast, scriptable system control for modern rootless jailbreaks. It lets you bind physical gestures and hardware buttons, or send commands remotely from your computer, to trigger system actions, control media playback, and run custom scripts.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **What's New in v2.4**
> - **Shake Trigger**: New "Motion Gestures" section with "Shake Device" trigger support. Assign any action sequence to fire when the device is physically shaken.
> - **Action Copy-Paste**: Long-press any action entry to copy it to a global clipboard. Once copied, long-press any row to "Paste Above" or "Paste Below", or long-press empty space to paste at the end of the sequence.
> - **App Launch Trigger**: Added a new trigger type that fires when a specific application is opened. Features a built-in search-enabled app picker.
> - **Conditional Actions ("Else" Branch)**: "If" actions now support an optional "Else" branch. Long-press any "If" action in the sequence list to toggle the Else branch on or off.
> - **Conditional Actions ("Front Application")**: Added a new condition type to check the currently active foreground application. Integrated the native app picker for easy configuration.
> - **Edit Condition**: Added a native "Edit Condition" option to the long-press menu for "If" actions, allowing you to swap conditions or values without deleting the entire block.
> - **Trigger Workflow**: Creating a new trigger (App Launch, NFC, etc.) now automatically redirects you to the action sequence configuration immediately for a faster setup process.

<summary><h3>Lua Scripting & Objective-C Bridge</h3></summary>

RemoteCompanion v2.2 introduces a powerful Lua bridge that allows you to execute arbitrary Lua scripts within the tweak's process. exact same context is available whether you run a script file from the CLI or paste code into the "Lua Script" action in the app.

### How to Run
- **From CLI**: `rc lua /path/to/script.lua`
- **From UI**: Add Action → System → **Custom Lua Script**. Paste your code directly into the prompt.

### API Bindings

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `log(msg)` | Writes to the system log (syslog). |
| `delay(seconds)` | Pauses execution for `seconds`. |
| `haptic()` | Triggers a standard haptic feedback. |
| `openURL(url)` | Opens a URL scheme (e.g. `prefs:root=General`). |
| `dlopen(path)` | Loads a dynamic library. Returns `true` on success. |
| `objc_call(target, selector, args...)` | Calls an Objective-C method. `target` can be a class name string or an instance. |

### Examples

**Trigger Haptic and Log**
```lua
log("Starting haptic engine...")
haptic()
delay(0.2)
haptic()
log("Finished haptic feedback.")
```

**Call a Class Method (get a shared instance)**
```lua
-- objc_call(className, selector) returns an instance
local device = objc_call("UIDevice", "currentDevice")
if device then
    objc_call(device, "setBatteryMonitoringEnabled:", true)
    local level = objc_call(device, "batteryLevel")
    log("Battery: " .. tostring(level * 100) .. "%")
end
```

**Load a Private Framework or Dylib**
```lua
-- Load your dylib first, then call methods on it
local ok = dlopen("/path/to/yourlibrary.dylib")
if ok then
    -- Use a shared accessor if the class provides one
    local instance = objc_call("YourClass", "sharedInstance")
    if instance then
        objc_call(instance, "yourMethod")
    else
        -- Or allocate a new instance
        local obj = objc_call(objc_call("YourClass", "alloc"), "init")
        objc_call(obj, "yourMethod")
    end
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> `objc_call` works like standard Objective-C messaging — it does not scan memory for existing instances. To call an instance method, you first need to obtain the instance via a class-level accessor (e.g. `sharedInstance`, `currentDevice`) or by allocating a new one with `alloc`/`init`.

<summary><h3>Blacklist (App Exclusion)</h3></summary>

RemoteCompanion includes a blacklist system to prevent hardware triggers and gestures from firing while specific apps are in the foreground. This is useful for avoiding conflicts with apps that use the same buttons or gestures (e.g. games, camera apps).

### CLI Commands
Use the `rc blacklist` command to manage the list:

*   `rc blacklist list`: View currently blacklisted bundle IDs.
*   `rc blacklist add <bundleID>`: Add an app to the blacklist (e.g. `rc blacklist add com.apple.camera`).
*   `rc blacklist remove <bundleID>`: Remove an app from the blacklist.
*   `rc blacklist reset`: Reset the blacklist to the factory defaults.

</details>

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
- A **Jailbroken Device** (iOS 14+). Supports both Rootless (iOS 15+) and Rootful (iOS 14) environments.
- The `RemoteCompanion` tweak installed.

### 2. Installation Options

#### Option 1: Repository (Recommended)
Add `https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion` to Sileo or Zebra

Add to Zebra -> zbra://sources/add/https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion

Add to Sileo -> sileo://source/https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion

#### Option 2: Manual Install
Download the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/saihgupr/remotecompanion/releases).

#### Option 3: Build from Source
`cd Tweak && make package install`.

### 3. Usage Options
Choose the control method that best fits your needs:

#### Option 1: CLI (Easiest)
Control your iPhone from your computer terminal using the `rc` script. It uses SSH to securely tunnel commands into a local UNIX socket on the device.

1. Copy the script to your path:
   ```bash
   chmod +x rc
   sudo cp rc /usr/local/bin/rc
   ```
2. Set your iPhone's IP (add this to your `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export RC_IPHONE_IP=iphone.local
   ```
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   rc play
   ```

#### Option 2: SSH Direct (Secure)
Control the device directly via SSH using the `rc` command installed on the iPhone.
This method works even if the external "TCP Server" is disabled in settings.

```bash
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc lock"
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc volume 50"
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc respring"
```

#### Option 3: Shortcuts (External Triggers)
Control your device using iOS Shortcuts. There are two primary ways:

**A. Using Native SSH (Localhost)**
The most reliable method without extra tweaks. Requires **OpenSSH**.
1. Add the **Run script over SSH** action.
2. Configure host settings:
   - **Host**: `localhost`
   - **Port**: `22`
   - **User**: `mobile` (or `root`)
   - **Password**: Your SSH password (default is `alpine`)
3. Enter your command:
   ```bash
   rc flashlight toggle
   rc dnd on
   ```

**B. Using Powercuts (Shell)**
If you have **Powercuts** installed, you can run `rc` commands directly via shell.
1. Add the **Run shell command** action.
2. Enter your command:
   ```bash
   rc open Music
   rc volume 50
   ```
   
<details>
<summary><h3>Home Assistant Setup</h3></summary>

The most reliable way to control your device from Home Assistant is via SSH.

```yaml
shell_command:
  iphone_remote: >
    ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mobile@YOUR_IPHONE_IP "rc {{ cmd }}"
```
Then call it with:

```yaml
service: shell_command.iphone_remote
data:
  cmd: 'play'
```

</details>

## Security

RemoteCompanion implements several measures to ensure your device remains secure:

- **Local Access**: Local apps and the `rc` CLI on the device communicate directly with the socket file, ensuring zero network exposure.

## Troubleshooting

### Apple Pay Issues
If you experience the "Updating Cards" screen or other conflicts with Apple Pay when waking your device, you can disable the background NFC scanning feature.
1. Go to the **Settings** tab (gear icon).
2. Toggle off **NFC Scanning**.

This ensures the tweak does not attempt to access the NFC controller on wake, resolving conflicts with system services.

### iOS 14 arm64e (A12+) Compatibility
Due to Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) changes in modern toolchains, iOS 14 on **arm64e (A12 and newer)** devices is currently unsupported and may cause a Safe Mode loop.
- **Supported**: iOS 14 on A11 and below (iPhone 8/X and older, iPad Air 2, etc.)
- **Supported**: iOS 15+ on all devices.
- **Workaround**: If you are on iOS 14 with a newer device, you may need to compile the tweak using **Xcode 15.4** or earlier to ensure correct PAC signatures.
