<details>
<summary><h3>Lua Scripting & Objective-C Bridge</h3></summary>

RemoteCompanion introduces a powerful Lua bridge that allows you to execute arbitrary Lua scripts within the tweak's process. The exact same context is available whether you run a script file from the CLI or paste code into the "Lua Script" action in the app.

### How to Run
- **From CLI**: `rc lua /path/to/script.lua`
- **From UI**: Add Action → System → **Custom Lua Script**. Paste your code directly into the prompt.

### API Bindings

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `log(msg)` | Writes to the system log (syslog). |
| `delay(seconds)` | Pauses execution for `seconds`. |
| `haptic()` | Triggers a standard haptic feedback. |
| `openURL(url)` | Opens a URL scheme (e.g. `prefs:root=General`). |
| `dlopen(path)` | Loads a dynamic library. Returns `true` on success. |
| `objc_call(target, selector, args...)` | Calls an Objective-C method. `target` can be a class name string or an instance. |

### Examples

**Trigger Haptic and Log**
```lua
log("Starting haptic engine...")
haptic()
delay(0.2)
haptic()
log("Finished haptic feedback.")
```

**Call a Class Method (get a shared instance)**
```lua
-- objc_call(className, selector) returns an instance
local device = objc_call("UIDevice", "currentDevice")
if device then
    objc_call(device, "setBatteryMonitoringEnabled:", true)
    local level = objc_call(device, "batteryLevel")
    log("Battery: " .. tostring(level * 100) .. "%")
end
```

**Load a Private Framework or Dylib**
```lua
-- Load your dylib first, then call methods on it
local ok = dlopen("/path/to/yourlibrary.dylib")
if ok then
    -- Use a shared accessor if the class provides one
    local instance = objc_call("YourClass", "sharedInstance")
    if instance then
        objc_call(instance, "yourMethod")
    else
        -- Or allocate a new instance
        local obj = objc_call(objc_call("YourClass", "alloc"), "init")
        objc_call(obj, "yourMethod")
    end
end
```

> [!NOTE]
> `objc_call` works like standard Objective-C messaging — it does not scan memory for existing instances. To call an instance method, you first need to obtain the instance via a class-level accessor (e.g. `sharedInstance`, `currentDevice`) or by allocating a new one with `alloc`/`init`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h3>Blacklist (App Exclusion)</h3></summary>

RemoteCompanion includes a blacklist system to prevent hardware triggers and gestures from firing while specific apps are in the foreground. This is useful for avoiding conflicts with apps that use the same buttons or gestures (e.g. games, camera apps).

### CLI Commands
Use the `rc blacklist` command to manage the list:

*   `rc blacklist list`: View currently blacklisted bundle IDs.
*   `rc blacklist add <bundleID>`: Add an app to the blacklist (e.g. `rc blacklist add com.apple.camera`).
*   `rc blacklist remove <bundleID>`: Remove an app from the blacklist.
*   `rc blacklist reset`: Reset the blacklist to the factory defaults.

</details>

## Getting Started

<details>
<summary><h3>1. Requirements</h3></summary>

- A **Jailbroken Device** (iOS 14+). Supports both Rootless (iOS 15+) and Rootful (iOS 14) environments.
- The `RemoteCompanion` tweak installed.

</details>

### 2. Installation Options

#### Option 1: Repository (Recommended)
Add `https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion` to Sileo or Zebra

Add to Zebra -> zbra://sources/add/https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion

Add to Sileo -> sileo://source/https://saihgupr.github.io/remotecompanion

#### Option 2: Manual Install
Download the `.deb` from [Releases](https://github.com/saihgupr/remotecompanion/releases).

#### Option 3: Build from Source
`cd Tweak && make package install`.

<details>
<summary><h3>3. Usage Options</h3></summary>

Choose the control method that best fits your needs:

#### Option 1: CLI (Easiest)
Control your iPhone from your computer terminal using the `rc` script. It uses SSH to securely tunnel commands into a local UNIX socket on the device.

1. Copy the script to your path:
   ```bash
   chmod +x rc
   sudo cp rc /usr/local/bin/rc
   ```
2. Set your iPhone's IP (add this to your `~/.zshrc`):
   ```bash
   export RC_IPHONE_IP=iphone.local
   ```
3. Run the command:
   ```bash
   rc play
   ```

#### Option 2: SSH Direct (Secure)
Control the device directly via SSH using the `rc` command installed on the iPhone.
This method works even if the external "TCP Server" is disabled in settings.

```bash
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc lock"
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc volume 50"
ssh mobile@iphone.local "rc respring"
```

<details>
<summary><h4>Option 3: Shortcuts (External Triggers)</h4></summary>

Control your device using iOS Shortcuts. There are two primary ways:

**A. Using Native SSH (Localhost)**
The most reliable method without extra tweaks. Requires **OpenSSH**.
1. Add the **Run script over SSH** action.
2. Configure host settings:
   - **Host**: `localhost`
   - **Port**: `22`
   - **User**: `mobile` (or `root`)
   - **Password**: Your SSH password (default is `alpine`)
3. Enter your command:
   ```bash
   rc flashlight toggle
   rc dnd on
   ```

**B. Using Powercuts (Shell)**
If you have **Powercuts** installed, you can run `rc` commands directly via shell.
1. Add the **Run shell command** action.
2. Enter your command:
   ```bash
   rc open Music
   rc volume 50
   ```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Option 4: HTTP API (Network Triggers)</h4></summary>

Control your device from any network-connected hardware via simple HTTP calls.

1. Enable **Web UI** in the RemoteCompanion Settings (Gear icon).
2. Send commands using `GET` or `POST`:

**Using GET (easiest for browser/simple callers):**
```bash
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command?cmd=play
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command?cmd=flashlight%20toggle
```

**Using POST (Query Parameters):**
*Allows sending commands via POST without a request body.*
```bash
curl -X POST "http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command?cmd=lock%20toggle"
```

**Using POST (JSON):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"command": "respring"}'
```

**Using POST (Raw Text):**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command" -d "haptic"
```

> [!TIP]
> This API is cross-platform and requires no special tools on the caller device, making it ideal for IoT integrations.

#### Performance & Security (API vs SSH)
The RemoteCommand HTTP API is designed for speed and compatibility.

*   **⚡ Speed**: Using the HTTP API is significantly faster than SSH (~0.1s faster per command). This is because it skips the heavy SSH handshake, public key exchange, and encryption overhead.
*   **🔋 Efficiency (Web UI)**: The Web UI server uses a **blocking `accept()` loop** on a background thread. This means it consumes **zero CPU cycles** when idle, sitting in a dormant state until a request is received. Enabling the Web UI in Settings has no measurable impact on idle battery life.
*   **📡 Efficiency (Schedules)**: Background scheduled triggers are optimized to wake the CPU only once per minute (aligned to the minute boundary), drastically reducing background drain compared to traditional polling.
*   **⚠️ Security**: Unlike SSH, the HTTP API is **NOT SECURE**. All data, including device passcodes, is sent in **plain-text** over your local network. 

> [!CAUTION]
> **Use at your own risk.** It is highly recommended to only enable the Web UI/API on a trusted, isolated IoT network. **Never** send your passcode via the API over an untrusted or public WiFi network.

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Remote Command API</h4></summary>

You can control your device by sending commands directly to the Remote Command API.

**1. Discover Available Commands:**
Get a list of all supported commands and their descriptions via the discovery endpoint:
```bash
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/commands
```

**2. Execute a Command:**

# Example: Lock orientation
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/command?cmd=rotate%20lock
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><h4>Running Automations via API</h4></summary>

You can also fire any multi-action automation sequence you've built in the app directly via their dedicated URLs.

**1. Discover your Automations:**
Call the discovery endpoint to see all configured triggers and their direct execution URLs:
```bash
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/triggers
```
Example Output:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "triggers": [
    {
      "id": "trigger_1",
      "name": "Good Night",
      "url": "/api/trigger/trigger_1"
    },
    {
      "id": "app_launch_com.apple.Music",
      "name": "Launch Music",
      "url": "/api/trigger/app_launch_com.apple.Music"
    }
  ]
}
```

**2. Execute the Automation:**
Simply perform a GET or POST request to the `url` provided in the discovery response:
```bash
# Example for trigger_1
http://[device_ip]:8080/api/trigger/trigger_1
```

> [!TIP]
> **Pro Tip:** In the Web UI, you can swipe any trigger or open the action editor and tap the **Copy** icon to instantly get the full URL (including your device's IP) for that specific trigger.

<summary><h3>Home Assistant Setup</h3></summary>

The most reliable way to control your device from Home Assistant is via SSH.

```yaml
shell_command:
  iphone_remote: >
    ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking=no" mobile@YOUR_IPHONE_IP "rc {{ cmd }}"
```
Then call it with:

```yaml
service: shell_command.iphone_remote
data:
  cmd: 'play'
```

</details>

</details>

## Security

RemoteCompanion implements several measures to ensure your device remains secure:

- **Local Access**: Local apps and the `rc` CLI on the device communicate directly with the socket file, ensuring zero network exposure.

<details>
<summary><h2>Troubleshooting</h2></summary>

### Apple Pay Issues
If you experience the "Updating Cards" screen or other conflicts with Apple Pay when waking your device, you can disable the background NFC scanning feature.
1. Go to the **Settings** tab (gear icon).
2. Toggle off **NFC Scanning**.

This ensures the tweak does not attempt to access the NFC controller on wake, resolving conflicts with system services.

### iOS 14 arm64e (A12+) Compatibility
Due to Pointer Authentication Code (PAC) changes in modern toolchains, iOS 14 on **arm64e (A12 and newer)** devices is currently unsupported and may cause a Safe Mode loop.
- **Supported**: iOS 14 on A11 and below (iPhone 8/X and older, iPad Air 2, etc.)
- **Supported**: iOS 15+ on all devices.
- **Workaround**: If you are on iOS 14 with a newer device, you may need to compile the tweak using **Xcode 15.4** or earlier to ensure correct PAC signatures.
